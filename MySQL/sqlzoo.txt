13.找出所有首都和其國家名字,而首都要有國家名字中出現。
	SELECT capital, name FROM world WHERE capital LIKE concat('%',name,'%');

15.顯示國家名字，及其延伸詞，如首都是國家名字的延伸。
	select name, mid(capital, length(name)+1)
	from world
	where capital like concat(name, '%')
	and name != capital;

	select name, replace(capital, name, '')
	from world
	where capital like concat(name, '%')
	and name != capital;


10.Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.

Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.
	select name, round(GDP/population,-3)
	from world
	where GDP > 1000000000000;

12.The capital ELECT mdate, team1, 
sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
team2,  
sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id
group by mdate, matchid, team1, team2;of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.
Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.
You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.

	SELECT name, capital
	FROM world
	where LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1)
	and name <> capital;

13.List the winners, year and subject where the winner starts with Sir. Show the the most recent first, then by name order.
	select winner, yr, subject 
	from nobel
	where winner like "Sir%"
	order by yr desc ,winner asc;

14.Show the 1984 winners and subject ordered by subject and winner name; but list Chemistry and Physics last.
tips:The expression subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics') can be used as a value - it will be 0 or 1.
	SELECT winner, subject
	  FROM nobel
	 WHERE yr=1984
	 ORDER BY subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics'), subject,winner;

5.Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
	select name ,concat(round(100*population/(select population from world where name = "Germany")),"%") 
	from world 
	where continent = "Europe";

8.List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
	select continent ,name from world a
	where a.name = (select name from world b
		where a.continent = b.continent
		group by name limit 1);
		
9.Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.***
	select name, continent ,population from world a
	where 25000000 >= all(select population from world b 
		where a.continent = b.continent 
		and b.population > 0);

10.Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.***
	select name , continent from world a 
	where a.population/3 >= all(select population from world b
		where a.continent = b.continent 
		and a.name != b.name 
		and b.population >0);

8.List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.
	select continent from (select continent,sum(population) as total from world group by continent)
	where total >= 100000000;

13.Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.
	SELECT mdate, team1, 
	sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
	team2,  
	sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
	FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id
	group by mdate, matchid, team1, team2;

	ps:it must be left join

10.List the films together with the leading star for all 1962 films.
	select m.title,a.name from movie m 
	join casting c on m.id = c.movieid 
	join actor a on c.actorid = a.id 
	where c.ord = 1 and m.yr = 1962;
	
13.Obtain a list, in alphabetical order, of actors who've had at least 15 starring roles.	
	select name from (select a.name,count(a.name) from casting c 
	join actor a 
	on a.id = c.actorid
	where c.ord = 1
	group by a.name
	having count(a.name) >= 15
	order by a.name ) b;

15.List all the people who have worked with 'Art Garfunkel'.
	select a.name from actor a
	join casting c
	on a.id = c.actorid
	join movie m
	on m.id = c.movieid
	where c.movieid in (select movieid from casting where actorid = (select id from actor where name = 'Art Garfunkel'))
	and name != 'Art Garfunkel';
